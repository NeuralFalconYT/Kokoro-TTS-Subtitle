## Installation

### Prerequisites
- At least Python 3.10
- Git
- (Optional) Virtual Environment for dependency isolation

### Steps to Install and Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   https://github.com/NeuralFalconYT/Kokoro-TTS-Subtitle.git
   cd Kokoro-TTS-Subtitle
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   - **Windows:**
     ```sh
     python -m venv myenv
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux:**
     ```sh
     python3 -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install PyTorch**
- **Forcefully install Torch with CUDA. If you did not, then requirements.txt will install the CPU version [It's happening with my system.]**
  - Check CUDA Version (for GPU setup):
    ```bash
    nvcc --version
    ```
    Find your CUDA version example ```11.8```

  - Visit [PyTorch Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install the version compatible with your CUDA setup.:<br>
    - For CUDA 11.8:
    ```
    pip install torch  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```
    - For CUDA 12.1:
    ```
    pip install torch  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    ```
    - For CUDA 12.4:
    ```
    pip install torch  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
    ```
    
4. **Install Dependencies**
   - **Windows/Mac/Linux:**
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Install eSpeak NG**

- **For Windows:**
  1. Download the eSpeak NG 1.50 release from the [eSpeak NG GitHub Releases](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/tag/1.50). [Or, You can try eSpeak NG latest Version]
  2. Locate and download the file named **`espeak-ng-X64.msi`**.
  3. Run the installer and follow the installation steps. Ensure that you install eSpeak NG in the default directory:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG
     ```
     > **Note:** This default path is required for the application to locate eSpeak NG properly.

- **For Linux:**
  1. Open your terminal.
  2. Install eSpeak NG using the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get -qq -y install espeak-ng > /dev/null 2>&1
     ```
     > **Note:** This command suppresses unnecessary output for a cleaner installation process.

5. **Run the Application**<br>
   If you used a virtual environment, make sure you enabled it.
   - **Windows/Mac/Linux:**
     ```sh
     python app.py
     ```
   Or,<br>
   ```
   python one_clicker.py
   ```
   Then, double-click on `run_app.bat` (Windows) to execute the script.
<br>

6. **Use Kokoko TTS Gradio app as an API in your other project:**  
   Check out ```scripts/api.py``` Code
